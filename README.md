# Street-View-Housing-Number-Digit-Recognition

## Introduction
Recognizing objects in natural scenes using deep learning techniques is a captivating and challenging task with numerous real-world applications. This project focuses on the recognition of house numbers from street view images, a problem that has practical significance in improving geographic information systems and enhancing location-based services.

## Objective
My objective is to develop models that can accurately recognize the digits in these images. I will explore and compare the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to determine the most effective approach for this task. This project not only demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in a practical context but also showcases the potential improvements in map quality and location accuracy that can be achieved through automated digit recognition.

## Dataset Information
In this project, I utilize the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, which comprises over 600,000 labeled digit images extracted from street-level photographs. This dataset is a benchmark in the field of image recognition and has been instrumental in advancements made by organizations such as Google for automatic address transcription, which aids in accurately pinpointing building locations.

## Data Preparation
### Visualiza some images in the dataset
